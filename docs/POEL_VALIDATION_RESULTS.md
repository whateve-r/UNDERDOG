### Key Observations

#### 1. **POEL Meta-Agent Coordination** ✅
```log
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO] POEL META-AGENT COORDINATION
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]   Purpose Score: -1001.23
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]   Global DD: 7.66% (Daily: 0.00%)
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]   Emergency Mode: False
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]   Capital Allocation:
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]     agent_EURUSD: 25.00% (Calmar:   0.00)
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]     agent_USDJPY: 25.00% (Calmar:   0.00)
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]     agent_XAUUSD: 25.00% (Calmar:   0.00)
2025-10-25 01:47:51,995 [INFO]     agent_GBPUSD: 25.00% (Calmar:   0.00)
2025-10-25 01:47:51,997 [INFO]   Failure Bank Size: 0
2025-10-25 01:47:51,997 [INFO]   Skill Bank Size: 0
```

**Analysis**:
- Purpose Score is negative (-1001.23) due to DD breach penalty
- Capital allocation is uniform (25%) because Calmar Ratio = 0.00 (insufficient history)
- **Expected**: After ~50 steps per agent, Calmar Ratios will become non-zero and allocation will diversify

#### 2. **Enriched Rewards Computed** ✅
The system successfully processes enriched rewards for all 4 agents with different observation sequence lengths:

- **EURUSD (TD3+LSTM)**: Input shape (60, 31) → Flattened to 1860-dim
- **USDJPY (PPO+CNN1D)**: Input shape (15, 31) → Flattened to 465-dim
- **XAUUSD (SAC+Transformer)**: Input shape (120, 31) → Flattened to 3720-dim
- **GBPUSD (DDPG+Attention)**: Input shape (31,) → 31-dim (no flattening)

**Critical Fix Applied**:
NoveltyDetector now auto-reinitializes on first use to match actual state dimensions:
```python
def _reinitialize_if_needed(self, state: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray):
    """Reinitialize dimensions if they don't match actual data"""
    actual_state_dim = state.shape[0] if state.ndim == 1 else np.prod(state.shape)
    # ...reinitialize state_mean, state_std, etc.
```

#### 3. **Episode Length** ⚠️
- **Current**: 3 steps average
- **Expected after training**: 20-50 steps
- **Reason for short episodes**: Agents are untrained and breach DD limits quickly
- **Next Step**: Compare 50-episode POEL vs Baseline to validate learning improvement

---

## 2. Issues Resolved During Validation

### Issue 1: `AttributeError: 'MultiAssetEnv' object has no attribute 'symbols'`
**Root Cause**: MultiAssetEnv stores symbols in `self.config.symbols`, not `self.symbols`

**Fix**: Updated train_marl_agent.py line 111:
```python
# Before:
symbols=env.symbols,

# After:
symbols=env.config.symbols,
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: `ValueError: operands could not broadcast together with shapes (1860,) (31,)`
**Root Cause**: NoveltyDetector initialized with `state_dim=31` but received flattened LSTM sequences (60×31=1860)

**Fix**: Added dynamic dimension adaptation to NoveltyDetector:
```python
def __init__(self, state_dim: int, ...):
    self.initialized = False  # Track if dimensions confirmed
    # ...

def _reinitialize_if_needed(self, state, action):
    if not self.initialized or actual_state_dim != self.state_dim:
        # Reinitialize with correct dimensions
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

```bash
poetry run python scripts/train_marl_agent.py \
    --episodes 50 \
    --symbols EURUSD USDJPY XAUUSD GBPUSD \
    --balance 100000
```

**Expected Metrics (from previous runs)**:
- Episode length: 2-8 steps
- DD breach rate: ~100%
- Balance volatility: High
- Calmar Ratio: Negative or near-zero

#### 3.2 POEL Run (With POEL) - **PENDING** ⏳

    --poel \
    --poel-alpha 0.7 \
    --poel-beta 1.0 \
    --nrf \
